## 📖 Understanding AIDE

### Theoretical Foundations

AIDE isn't created from scratch—it combines best practices from proven fields:

- **RACI-D** → From project management RACI matrix
- **STATE** → From software engineering state machines
- **IOCA** → From systems theory and control theory
- **MBVE** → From organizational learning theory

### Relationship with Technical Frameworks

```
Technical Layer (for developers):
ReAct/CoT/ToT → Underlying logic for STATE transitions

Business Layer (for everyone):
AIDE Standard → Design AI employees in business language, no coding needed

Relationship:
AIDE runs on top of ReAct/CoT frameworks
Business people use AIDE to design, developers use ReAct to implement
```
